Thanks to:
    Michael "mf0102" Farber, for testing coefficients, and speaking up
    when they were CLEARLY WRONG, writing patches and trying to break
    the emulation code. upse would not sound the way it does without
    his help, and probably would not be nearly as accurate.

    Xodnizel, for writing SexyPSF, which provided for some motivation
    for writing a PSF replayer.

    CaitSith2 for explaining a lot of details on how the PSF format in
    general works on his webpages.

    Tony Vroon and Giacomo Lozito for their hard work on the plugins
    collection in Audacious (SexyPSF would not have ever been realised
    on Audacious without their efforts, and as such, UPSE would never
    exist.)

    Neill Corlett for a lot of research information about when to apply
    what coefficients and filters and such. He was the first one to write
    a somewhat accurate SPU emulation, and this one builds on his research.

    Pete Bernert for writing PeOPS, which, while inaccurate, is the only
    really complete SPU implementation that is open source. Hopefully,
    someone will hack UPSE into a PSX/PS2 software SPU now. ;)

    ||basement for hosting many esoteric PSX mod rips which can now be
    enjoyed without the use of Highly Experimental. Check out his archive
    at <http://tzone.org/~llin/psf/>.

    If I missed somebody, I'm sorry, and you should consider yourself
    thanked too.
