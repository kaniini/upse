upse 0.6.0 (2008-02-10):

* the "protect the fact that information is free" release.
* Add option to load in a PSone ROM image for replayers which
  need it. No UPSE will not come with a ROM image, and no I won't
  tell you where you can get one. Pro tip: I got mine by JTAGing my
  PSone, and you can do the same. Also, some replayers seem to use values
  in the ROM which changes the way the replayer plays back the sound.
  (crash2.psflib, I'm looking at you for _all_ of the above.)
* Do some reworking of the analogue filter on the SPU.
* upse123: Add -B option to specify a playstation ROM image.
* HLE bios: Display function ID on unimplemented syscalls.

upse 0.5.0 (2007-12-28):

* fix some bugs and other stuff

upse 0.4.0 (2007-11-19):

* first public release
